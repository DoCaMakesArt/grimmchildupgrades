# Grimm Child Upgrades

A simple Hollow Knight mod supporting lifeblood that buffs the player's grimmchild to make it a better, and more useful charm.

Hate grimmchild? Well you will love the new one who is:

* Moves and shoots faster
* Fires quicker fireballs
* Is quieter (60% normal volume by default)
* Deals more damage
* Fires larger fireballs far more accurately, which can travel through the ground.
* ...But costs more notches

Other features:

* Optional Infinite Grimm integration- The better you do, the stronger your grimmchild will become.
* Fully customizable power levels. For those of you with better ideas about what "balance" means. Set grimmchild's damage to 10,000 or volume to maximum if you want.
* Choose Grimmchild's color, or even opacity. Why limit your fire god to red?

### How to install

This mod depends on:

[ModCommon](https://github.com/Kerr1291/ModCommon) by Kerr1291

[Modding API](https://github.com/seanpr96/HollowKnight.Modding) by Wyza, Firzen, and Seanpr

So first install these from either github or the google drive.

Then download or compile the Grimmchild Upgrades dll from the "releases" section.

It is highly recommended you install this mod alongside [Infinite Grimm](https://github.com/natis1/infinitegrimm):
