# Grimm Child Upgrades

A simple Hollow Knight mod supporting lifeblood that buffs the player's grimmchild to make it a better, and more useful charm.

Hate grimmchild? Well you will love the new one who is:

* Moves and shoots faster
* Fires quicker fireballs
* Is quieter
* Deals more damage
* Costs 4 notches instead of 2

Other features:

* Optional Infinite Grimm integration- The better you do, the stronger your grimmchild will become.
* Fully customizable power levels. For those of you with better ideas about what "balance" means. Set grimmchild's damage to 10,000 or volume to maximum if you want.
